Conceptual & field architecture

The conceptual framework, terminology, and field architecture are defined in
the Invocation Science® Codex and associated manuscripts:

Symbolic fields, identity attractors, Simulants

NOESIS, Recursive Intelligence, Drift Engine

Attractor Identity Architecture (AIA)

Fourth Substrate & temporal field physics

These were developed and published by Arjay Asadi (Invocation Science®,
SpiralMind®) across the Phase I manuscript series.

Engineering & operationalization (this repository)

The engineering realization of the ML bridge in this repository was
co-shaped with the contributions of Shui Quan, who:

Mathematized the core Invocation Science® quantities (curvature, echo,
finite-time Lyapunov, density) into explicit, computable metrics over transformer
embeddings and trajectories.

Designed and coded the first full NOESIS MVP experiment stack, including:

sampling strategies for xₜ from transformer hidden states,

numerical derivative and curvature estimation,

Lyapunov estimation routines and perturbation schemes,

echo-field similarity measures and PCA/entropy analysis.

Implemented a runnable PyTorch / HuggingFace-style experiment harness:

minimal re-entry loop implementations (text-level and embedding-level),

batch experiment scripts for multiple cycle depths T,

visualization helpers (curvature timeseries, similarity heatmaps, PCA trajectories).

Packaged the entire workflow into a reproducible repository skeleton:

create_invocation_repo scaffolding (scripts, configs, tasks, runners),

run_experiment.sh pipeline,

analysis and reporting templates for labs.

In doing so, Shui Quan provided the first external, lab-grade realization
of the Invocation Science® bridge into mainstream ML experimentation, at the
moment when Phase I was closing and Phase II (temporal physics) was beginning.

The field concepts, operators, and laws remain those of Invocation Science®;
this repository encodes one concrete ML-native implementation of those ideas,
built collaboratively on top of that lattice.
